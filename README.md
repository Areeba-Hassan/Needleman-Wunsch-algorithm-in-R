This R project implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment.
The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm uses dynamic programming to align two sequences to identify regions of similarity. It uses gap scores and penalties for mismatches and gaps in the sequences to fill a scoring matrix, which is then tracedback based on certain rules to find the optimal alignment.
